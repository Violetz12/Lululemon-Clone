# Lululemon-Clone
Hi, this is my website for my school project. Our task was to make a clone website of an apparel brand, and I chose **Lululemon**.

This project showcases a simplified version of the Lululemon website, focusing on its design and basic functionality. It's intended for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with the official Lululemon brand.
